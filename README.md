# AUTOCROSS-Management-Program
Autocross is a form of motor racing involving skillfully driving cars around an obstacle course, usually marked out by cones on an empty car park. It
is upcoming sport in Jamaica that has been gaining popularity and significant support over the past few years. Many drivers have started taking parts
in rallies across Jamaica, under the Jamaica Race Drivers Club. There are now approximately 120 active members in the Club, headed by board of 9
directors. In 2003 it was revived with the purpose of the organization and promotion of motor racing. The Dover Raceway located just north of Brown’s
Town, St. Ann and now at Jamaica's 2nd circuit track: Jamwest Motorsports and Adventure Park in Old Hope, Westmoreland are the main areas where
the autocross sport events are held.
Many drivers and participants in these races own multiple of these racing vehicles, and there are several types of racing cars used, such as a Mustang,
BMW 3-Series, Camaro/Firebird, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Porsche 944, Honda CRX and so on. They each have different parts and specifications, but the
variety of cars come together to make an interesting and exciting completion. Each driver has his or her own supply of parts and repair needs, and
usually owns more than one car. Even damaged cars are kept for a period of time. They also usually repair, maintain, customize and sometimes build
their own cars, using their own parts or parts bought from a supplier. These cars are built for leisure, selling, or to be used in the next racing event.

The aim of this project is to create an automated system which carries out the following objectives:
• To provide an easy to use user interface to view the inventory
• To provide accurate solutions in terms of matching
• To provide efficient means of identifying compatible parts and make interchanging parts more efficient
• To provide a cheap method to efficiently organize and sort car inventory
• To provide an organized method of storing car and parts information.
Overall, the objectives are to carry out these functions with improved overall efficiency, costliness and accuracy than the previous system.
